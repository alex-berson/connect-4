## Description

**Connect Four** (also known as **Four in a Row**, **Four Up**, **Plot Four**, **Find Four**, **Drop Four**, **Captain's Mistress**, and **Gravitrips**) is a two-player connection board game in which players select a color and take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The discs fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space in the column. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs of one's own color.
