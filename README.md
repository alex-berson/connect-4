## Description

**Connect Four** (also known as **Four in a Row**, **Four Up**, **Plot Four**, **Find Four**, **Captain's Mistress**, **Drop Four**, and **Gravitrips**) is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.
